  "FAQ": {
    "tagline": "FAQ",
    "title": "Frequently asked questions",
    "items": [
      { "question": "What exactly is a digital secretary?", "answer": "It's an AI-powered system that replaces all repetitive admin tasks: automatic responses to messages (WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram), online appointment booking 24/7, quotes sent in 2 clicks, automatic follow-ups, client tracking, reminders... In short, everything a secretary does — without a salary, without holidays, without forgotten follow-ups." },
      { "question": "How is it better than a traditional secretary?", "answer": "A secretary costs ~€2,500/month gross + social contributions, over €30,000/year. She works 8h/day, takes holidays, can fall ill or resign. And human error happens: forgotten reminders, late quotes, wrong appointments... Our system works 24/7, never makes mistakes, and costs a one-time investment." },
      { "question": "I do everything myself, I don't have a secretary. Is this for me?", "answer": "Especially for you. If you spend your evenings answering emails, entering invoices in Excel and doing quotes instead of growing your business — that's exactly what we solve. We free up 15+ hours/week of admin so you can focus on your craft." },
      { "question": "How long does setup take?", "answer": "First operational version in 30 days: your digital secretary is running, you're already saving time. Final version delivered in 60 days: complete system, optimised, with training included so you're 100% autonomous." },
      { "question": "Does it work for my trade?", "answer": "If you're an entrepreneur, tradesman or service provider and you're losing time on admin — it's made for you. Plumber, heating engineer, electrician, mechanic, carpenter, cleaning, wellness, catering... We adapt to your reality on the ground." },
      { "question": "Is it complicated to use?", "answer": "Not at all. Everything is designed to be usable from your smartphone, between jobs. If you can send a WhatsApp, you can manage everything. And we train you so you're comfortable from day one." },
      { "question": "What's included in the system?", "answer": "Everything you need to never play secretary again: client CRM, online diary 24/7, quote generator, invoices, automatic WhatsApp reminders, automated responses across all channels, dashboard, and management from your phone. We adapt to your trade." },
      { "question": "Are there hidden fees?", "answer": "No. Your admin application is a one-time payment — no subscription. The only recurring cost is infrastructure maintenance (server, database, security, backups) at €50/month, and we offer the first year free. The quote is clear, no fine print." }
